Markdown vs Restructured Text
=============================

Markdown
--------

Emacs has good support for markdown:
- folding
- create tables

It is easier to document in markdown - less verbose.

Hugo:
- Seems really easy to work with
- Nice support for taxonomies i.e. tags, categories, etc
- I don't have to deal with the built output - very convenient for writing local documentation

Restructured Text
-----------------

Emacs support not as good as with markdown.

Seems like this is for technical documentation.

I miss the markdown setup at times and might consider moving back.

Sphinx:
- Search functionality out of the box
