"The solvency ratio is a key figure that you can use to get an overview of how large a share of your company's assets is invested in debt, seen in relation to the size of your company's equity. The solvency ratio is a measure of how strong your company will be in a possible financial crisis." https://dinero.dk/ordbog/soliditetsgrad/
