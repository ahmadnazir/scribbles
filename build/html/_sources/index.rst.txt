   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Scribbles
=========

This is where I keep all the notes that are either *too long that I would forget
them* OR *too short for a blog post*. This is a **work in progress ... and will
remain so** for the forseeable future.

If you notice something off and want to contribute, feel free to create a pull
