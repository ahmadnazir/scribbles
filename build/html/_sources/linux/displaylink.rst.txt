Displaylink on Ubuntu 18.04
===========================


I want to use additional monitors and I got a `ThinkPad Hybrid USB-C with USB-A Dock`_
It looks like this:

.. image:: images/displaylink.webp
   :width: 25%


On the back side it says 'Plug and Display' ... but that doesn't work if you are linux.

Following shady steps are required:

1. Install the offical drivers
------------------------------
Get the `official drivers`_ and install them. The installer bash script (apparently generated using makeself_ contains an eval statement on a bunch of binary.. and it needs root permissions. Hmmm...

The installer seems to be loading a kernel module. The following is taken from the official site:

2. Disable `UEFI/Secure Boot`_
------------------------------
`UEFI/Secure Boot`_ needs to be disabled from the BIOS setup. This means that we are allowing untrusted code to be run.


3. Perfomance Issues / CPU Load
-------------------------------
On top of that, CPU usage is extremely high:


  .. code:: bash

    $ ps -p `get-pid displaylink` -o %cpu,%mem,cmd
    %CPU %MEM CMD
    35.8  0.7 /opt/displaylink/DisplayLinkManager
    

And when I tap a few keys on the keyboard, it goes up to 50% and sometimes even
more. Not sure what is going on.

I really want to use additional monitors but I am not sure if I should use this
product. Maybe someone more wiser out there can help. _I need
healing!_.

  .. code:: bash

    get-pid () {
      local name=$1 
      ps aux | grep -i $name | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'
    }
