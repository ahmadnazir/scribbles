Intermediate Language (IL)
==========================

Also referred to CIL (Common IL) or MSIL (Microsoft IL).

I think ILAsm (IL Assembly Language) is also the same thing but not really sure. (not ILASM, the assembler)


Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)
------------------------------------

It is an open specification developed by Microsoft and standardized by ISO and Ecma.

Examples: .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono

Among other things, CLI describes the following 4 aspects:

- **CTS** or Common Type System
- Metadata: Info about language structure
- **CLS** or Common Language Specification: For inter-operability between languages
- **VES** or Virtual Execution Engine: For compiling IL to native code and running it.
