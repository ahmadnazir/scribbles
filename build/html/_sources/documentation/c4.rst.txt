C4 model
========

Buildings have specific floor plans, site plans, etc. There is no standard for software architecture. C4 tries to solve this.

It uses the following levels of abstraction (top down):

- Context (Software system): e.g. banking system etc
- Containers: e.g. webapps, databases, file systems, shell scripts etc
- Components: e.g. collection of implementation classes
- Code: e.g. classes, interfaces, objects, functions etc

In a nutshell (from `c4model.com`_):
