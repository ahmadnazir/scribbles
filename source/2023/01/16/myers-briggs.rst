Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a type of personality tests that categorizes people in the following groups:

- Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I) : Do you get energy from outside vs inside?
- Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N) : Do you evaluate based on reality or what could be?
- Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F) : For making decisions, do you use logic vs personal values?
- Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P) : Do you live your life with a plan or spontaneously?

Apparently, I am an `INTJ`.
