.. note::

  How can we use probablistic methods for cleaning data using the data that is being fixed.
  A declarative (instead of implerative) and principled (instead of heuristical) approacht to the problem.
  A different take on 'declarative' programing.
  Interesting to see why we won't use 'prolog' i.e. we don't know the constraints of the system. https://youtu.be/MiiWzJE0fEA?t=480

.. note::

   Bottom line, if you write stuff down, it helps you find problems. The more
   specific you are about your design, the more problems you find. The best you can
   do is to use formal methods to specify the systems. This is where alloy comes
   in.

   Jay Parlar goes through a simple example and uses alloy to find counter examples
   in the system that doesn't satisfy the checks.
