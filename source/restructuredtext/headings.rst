From https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#headings:

.. code::

   # with overline, for parts
   * with overline, for chapters
   =, for sections
   -, for subsections
   ^, for subsubsections
   “, for paragraphs


This project uses `=` and `-` as there are no parts or chapters.
