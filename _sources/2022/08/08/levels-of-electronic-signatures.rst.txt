Levels of Electronic Signatures
===============================

There are 3 levels:

1. Simple Electronic Signatures: "data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign".
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN#d1e791-73-1

2. Advanced Electronic Signatures (AdES): identifies the signatory / non-repudiation

3. Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES): created by a qualified signature creation device (QSCD) / uses qualified certificates

QES at a minimum is legally equal to a hand-written signature. That doesn't mean that simple signatures or AdES is not - the court can decide on a case to case basis.
