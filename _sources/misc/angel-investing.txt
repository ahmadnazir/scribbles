Angel Investing
===============

Best way to get into it is to get involved into a fund managed by someone else.
According to angel list, there are 3 options:

- Rolling funds
- Mutual funds
- Syndicates

Rolling funds are the most convenient. No deal selection. Consider Shaan Puri's
fund - the minimum contribution for a quarter is USD 6,250. Drawback is that you
don't get visibility to the deals.

Mutual funds have higher contribution requirements. Same draw back - no deal selection.

Syndicates give you deal selection. It is managed by a proven angel.

Not sure if you show up as an LP in any of the investments for the above
options. Not sure about angel list deal-by-deal investing. My application is
pending - will know in some time.
