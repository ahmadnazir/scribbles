Rules for the Daily Stand-up
============================

Rules for the meeting:

- **Keep it short** - max 2 minutes. Keep standing to enforce this

- **Format** should be

  - What did you do since last meeting
  - What are you planning on accomplishing until next meeting
  - What is blocking you?

- **Focus on what you want to achieve** instead of what is keeping you busy

Make sure that you avoid some bad habits:

- **Don't wait for everyone to start the meeting**. Start on time and stick to a schedule
- **Don't introduce new topics** Stick to what was planned - wait till the end to fork a different discussion if needed
- **Don't let people ramble**. Everyone should have the to interrupt in a polite way if the discussion is going off topic
