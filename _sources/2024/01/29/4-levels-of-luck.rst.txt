4 levels:

- Blind Luck : i.e. winning a lottery
- Luck from Motion : Increase the surface area of being lucky by taking relevant action
- Luck from Awareness : Be so skillful that you can see the opportunities that others don't
- Luck from Uniqueness : Be so known for your skill that people reach out to you when an opportunity arrises

So, one can improve their chances of being lucky.

"If opportunity doesnâ€™t knock, build a door." Milton Berle
