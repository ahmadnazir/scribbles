Access Control
==============

Following are the different types of access control mechanisms:

#. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

   Controlled by an admin.

#. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

   Controlled by the users who own the data (or at the discretion of the owner).

#. Role based Access Control (RBAC)

   Users with specific roles can access the data.
   It is usually the admins who assign roles to users.


#. Rule based Access Control (RuBAC)

   I think this is the same as policy based.


#. Attribute based Access Control
